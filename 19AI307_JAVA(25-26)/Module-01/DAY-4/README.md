# Ex.No:1(D) ARRAYS

## QUESTION:
Write a Java program to count how many elements in an array are divisible by 3 or 5



## AIM:
To implement a Java program to count how many elements in an array are divisible by 3 or 5


## ALGORITHM :
1. Read the value of n and input n integers into the array.
2. Initialize a counter variable count to 0.
3. Traverse the array from index 0 to n−1.
4. For each element, check if it is divisible by 3 or divisible by 5; if yes, increment count.
5. After the loop ends, print the value of count.

    public static void main(String[] args){ 
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in); 
        int n=sc.nextInt(); 
        int[] arr=new int[n]; 
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
        }
        
        int count=0;
        
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(arr[i]%3==0 || arr[i]%5==0)
            {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        System.out.print(count);
    }
}
