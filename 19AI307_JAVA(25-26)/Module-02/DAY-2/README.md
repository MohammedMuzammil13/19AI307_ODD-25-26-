# Ex.No:2(B) METHODS

## QUESTION:
Write a class with one static method and one non-static method. Call both from the main() method.
When staticMethod() is called, it should print  "I am static".
When nonStaticMethod() is called, it should print  "I am non-static"

## AIM:
To write a class with one static method and one non-static method. 


## ALGORITHM :
1. Create a class test that contains a static method st() and a non-static method nst().
2. In the main method, create an object of the class test.
3. Call the static method st() using the class name.
4. Call the non-static method nst() using the created object.
5. Display the corresponding messages for both method calls.
